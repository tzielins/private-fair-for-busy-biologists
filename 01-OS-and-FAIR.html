<p>Science works best by exchanging ideas and building on them. Most
efficient science involves both questions and experiments being made as
fully informed as possible, which requires the free exchange of data and
information.</p>
<p>All practices that make knowledge and data <strong>freely
available</strong> fall under the umbrella-term of <strong>Open
Science/Open Research</strong>. It makes science <strong>more
reproducible, transparent, and accessible</strong>. As science becomes
more open, the way we conduct and communicate science changes
continuously.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Open science is the movement to make scientific research (including
publications, data, physical samples, and software) and its
dissemination <strong>accessible to all levels</strong> of an inquiring
society, amateur or professional.</p>
<p>Open Science represents a new approach to the scientific process
based on <strong>cooperative work</strong> and new ways of diffusing
knowledge by <strong>using digital technologies</strong> and new
collaborative tools.</p>
<p>Open science is <strong>transparent and accessible knowledge</strong>
that is shared and developed through collaborative networks.</p>
<p>Characteristics:</p>
<ul><li>Using web-based tools to facilitate information exchange and
scientific collaboration</li>
<li>Transparency in experimental methodology, observation, and
collection of data</li>
<li>Public availability and reusability of scientific data, methods and
communications</li>
<li>various outputs and audiences</li>
</ul></div>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="what-is-the-open-science-movement">What is the Open Science movement?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-is-the-open-science-movement"></a></h3>
<p>The distribution of knowledge has always been subject to improvement.
Whilst the internet was initially developed for military purposes, it
was hijacked for communication between scientists, which provided a
viable route to change the dissemination of science.</p>
<p>The momentum has built up with a change in the way science is
communicated to reflect what research communities are calling for –
solutions to the majority of problems (e.g. impact factors, data
reusability, reproducibility crisis, trust in the public science sector
etc…) that we face today.</p>
<p>Open Science is the movement to increase transparency and
reproducibility of research, through using the open best practices.</p>

<ul><li><p><strong>Open Access:</strong> Research outputs hosted in a way
that make them accessible for everyone. Traditionally Open Access
referred to journal articles, but now includes books, chapters or
images.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Data:</strong> Data freely and readily available to
access, reuse, and share. Smaller data sets were often accessible as
supplemental materials by journals alongside articles themselves.
However, they should be hosted in dedicated platforms for more
convenient and better access.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Software:</strong> Software where the source code is
made readily available; others are free to use, change, and share. Some
examples of these including the coding language and supporting software
R and RStudio, as well as image analysis software such as
Fiji/ImageJ.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Notebooks:</strong> Lab &amp; notebooks hosted
online, readily accessible to all. These are popular among some of the
large funding bodies and allow anyone to comment on any stage of the
experimental record.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Peer Review:</strong> A system where peer review
reports are published alongside the body of work. This can include
reviewers’ reports, correspondence between parties involved, rebuttals,
editorial decisions etc…</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Citizens Science:</strong> Lay people become involved in
scientific research, most commonly in data collection or image analysis.
Platforms such as <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/" class="external-link">zooniverse.org</a> help connect
projects with lay people interested in playing an active role in
research, which can help generate and/or process data which would
otherwise be unachievable by one single person.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scientific social networks:</strong> Networks of
researchers, which often meet locally in teams, but are also connected
online, foster open discussions on scientific issues. Online, many
people commonly use traditional social media platforms for this, such as
Twitter, Instagram, various sub-reddits, discussion channels on
Slack/Discord etc…, although there are also more dedicated spaces such
as <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/" class="external-link">researchgate.net</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Open Education resources:</strong> Educational materials
that are free for anyone to access and use to learn from. These can be
anything from talks, instructional videos, and explanations posted on
video hosting websites (e.g. YouTube), to entire digital textbooks
written and then published freely online.</p></li>

<h3 id="benefits-of-open-science">Benefits of Open Science<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#benefits-of-open-science"></a></h3>
<p>Possible benefits and consequences for each OS module:</p>
<p><strong>Open Access</strong></p>
<ul><li>speed of knowledge distribution</li>
<li>leveling field for underfunded sites which otherwise wouldn’t be
able to navigate the paywall</li>
<li>prevent articles being paid for ‘thrice’ (first to produce, second

<p>One has to consider the moral objectives that accompany the
research/publication process: charities/taxpayers pay to fund research,
these then pay again to access the research they already funded.</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, scientific outputs generated by
public research are a public good that everyone should be able to use at
no cost.</p>
<p>According to EU report <a href="https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/d375368c-1a0a-11e9-8d04-01aa75ed71a1" class="external-link">“Cost-benefit

of not accessible data (plus additional 16bn if accounting for re-use
and research quality).</p>
<p>The goals of Open Science is to make research and research data
available to e.g. charities/taxpayers who funded this research.</p>

<p>The Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) emerged from a
recognition of the limitations and biases associated with journal-based
metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors. Motivated by a desire to
promote fair and transparent evaluation practices, DORA advocates for
assessing research based on its intrinsic merits rather than the venue
of publication. Its realization signifies a paradigm shift in how we
measure the impact and significance of scholarly work, emphasizing the
importance of quality, openness, and broader societal impacts.</p>

<p>Funders worldwide are increasingly recognizing the importance of
embracing DORA principles in their assessment criteria. Institutions
like Wellcome and Cancer Research UK have led the charge by
incorporating DORA principles into their funding applications. By
prioritizing factors such as research outputs, contributions to
mentorship, and plans for public engagement, these funders are signaling
a commitment to supporting research that generates meaningful knowledge,
fosters collaborations, and contributes to societal well-being.</p>

<p>The Narrative CV offers a DORA-compliant approach to evaluating
researchers, focusing on key dimensions that reflect the principles of
DORA:</p>
<ul><li>Generation of Knowledge: Acknowledging diverse outputs such as
datasets, patents, and software.</li>
<li>Development of Individuals and Collaborations: Highlighting
mentorship and collaborative endeavors that enrich the research
ecosystem.</li>
<li>Supporting Broader Society and the Economy: Demonstrating the
societal and economic impacts of research beyond academic circles.</li>
<li>Supporting the Research Community: Engaging in open science
practices and ensuring the accessibility of research outputs.</li>
</ul><p>In this assessment framework, special attention is paid to Open
Science practices, ensuring that research outputs are openly available
to maximize their impact and visibility. Additionally, new metrics such
as retweets, online views and downloads, discussions, and presence in
mass media and technology platforms are considered to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of research impact in today’s digital
age.</p>
<p>Embracing Open Practices and adhering to DORA principles not only
aligns with ethical research conduct but also enhances the credibility
and impact of scholarly work. As evidenced by the Narrative CV and the
adoption of DORA principles by leading funders, the research community
is moving towards a more transparent and equitable assessment paradigm.
Ultimately, the choice to embrace Open Practices is not only a matter of
integrity but also a recognition that authenticity and transparency are
essential drivers of scientific progress. After all, as timestamps
remind us, faking Open Practices is far more challenging than simply
adhering to them.</p>

<p>(9 min teaching)</p>
<p>It may seem obvious that we should adopt open science practices, but
there are associated challenges with doing so.</p>
<p>Sensitivity of data is sometimes considered a barrier. Shared data
needs to be compliant with data privacy laws, leading many to shy away
from hosting it publicly. Anonymising data to desensitise it can help
overcome this barrier.</p>
<p>The potential for intellectual property on research can dissuade some
from adopting open practices. Again, much can be shared if the data is
filtered carefully to protect anything relating to intellectual
property.</p>
<p>Another risk could be seen with work on Covid19: pre-prints. A
manuscript hosted publicly prior to peer review, may accelerate access
to knowledge, but can also be misused and/or misunderstood. This can
result in political and health decision making based on faulty data,
which is counter to societies’ best interest.</p>
<p>One concern is that opening up ones data to the scientific community
can lead to the identification of errors, which may lead to feelings of
embarrassment. However, this could be considered an upside - we should
seek for our work to be scrutinized and errors to be pointed out, and is
the sign of a competent scientist. One should rather have errors pointed
out rather than risking that irreproducible data might cause even more
embarrassment and disaster.</p>
<p>One of <strong>the biggest barriers are the costs</strong> involved
in “being Open”. Firstly, making outputs readily available and usable to
others takes time and significant effort. Secondly, there are costs of
hosting and storage. For example, microscopy datasets reach sizes in
terabytes, making such data accessible for 10 years involves serious
financial commitment.</p>

<p>The above examples illustrate the typical challenges in accessing
research data and software. Firstly, data/protocols/software often do
not have an identity of their own, but only accompany a publication.
Second, they are not easily accessible or reusable, for example, all the
details are inside one supporting information PDF file. Such file
includes “printed” numerical table or even source code, both of which
need to be “re-typed” if someone would like to use them. Data are shared
in proprietary file format specific to a particular vendor and not
accessible if one does not have a particular software that accompanies
the equipment. Finally, data files are provided without detailed
description other than the whole article text.</p>
<p>In our examples, the protocol was difficult to <strong>find</strong>
(the loops), difficult to <strong>access</strong> (pay wall), and not
<strong>reusable</strong> as it lacked the necessary details (dead-end).
In the second example the data were not <strong>interoperable</strong>
and <strong>reusable</strong> as their were only available as a figure
graph.</p>
<p>To avoid such problems FAIR principles were designed.</p>

Principles for scientific data management and stewardship</a> were
published in Scientific Data. The original guideline focused on
“machine-actionability” - the ability of computer systems to operate on
data with minimal human intervention. However, now the focus has shifted
to making data accessible from a human perspective, and not an automated
one (mostly due to the lack of user friendly tools that could help deal
with standards and structured metadata).</p>
<p><strong>Findable</strong>: Easy to find data and metadata for both
humans and computers. Automatic and reliable discovery of datasets and
services depends on machine-readable persistent identifiers (PIDs) and
metadata.</p>
<p><strong>Accessible</strong>: (Meta)data should be retrievable by
their identifier using a standardized and open communications protocol
(including authentication and authorisation). Metadata should be
available even when the data are no longer available.</p>
<p><strong>Interoperable</strong>: Data should be able to be combined
with and used with other data or tools. The format of the data should be
open and interpretable for various tools. It applies both to data and
metadata, (meta)data should use vocabularies that follow FAIR
principles.</p>
<p><strong>Re-usable</strong>: FAIR aims at optimizing the reuse of
data. Metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be
replicated and/or combined in different settings. The reuse of
(meta)data should be stated with clear and accessible license(s).</p>

<div id="collapseSpoiler1" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionSpoiler1" aria-labelledby="headingSpoiler1">
<div class="accordion-body">
<p>A persistent identifier is a long-lasting reference to a digital
resource. Typically it has two components:</p>
<ul><li>a service that locates the resource over time even when its location
changes</li>
<li>and a unique identifier (that distinguishes the resource or concept
from others).</li>
</ul><p>Persistent identifiers aim to solve the problem of the persistence of
accessing cited resource, particularly in the field of academic
literature. All too often, web addresses (links) changes over time and
fail to take you to the referenced resource you expected.</p>
<p>There are several services and technologies (schemes) that provide
PIDs for objects (whether digital, physical or abstract). One of the
most popular is <strong>Digital Object Identifier <a href="https://www.doi.org/" class="external-link">(DOI)</a></strong>, recognizable by the
prefix doi.org in the web links. For example: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18" class="external-link">https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18</a>
resolves to the location of the paper that describes FAIR
principles.</p>
<p>Public repositories often maintain web addresses of their content in
a stable form which follow the convention <a href="http://repository.adress/identifier" class="external-link uri">http://repository.adress/identifier</a>; these are often
called permalinks. For well establish services, permalinks can be
treated as PIDs.</p>
<p>For example: <a href="http://identifiers.org/SO:0000167" class="external-link">http://identifiers.org/SO:0000167</a>
resolves to a page defining promoter role, and can be used to annotate
part of a DNA sequence as performing such a role during
transcription.</p>

<p>The FAIR acronym is sometimes accompanied with the following labels:
* Findable - Citable * Accessible - Trackable and countable *
Interoperable - Intelligible * Reusable - Reproducible</p>
<p>## Solution</p>
<ul><li>Findable data have their own identity, so they can be easily cited
and secure the credits to the authors</li>
<li>Data accessibility over the Internet using standard protocols can be
easily monitored (for example using Google analytics). This results in
metrics on data popularity or even geo-locations of data users.</li>
<li>Interoperable data can benefit the future you, for example you will
be able to still read your data even when you no longer have access to
the specialized, vendor specific software with which you worked with
them before. Also the future you may not remember abreviations and
ad-hoc conventions you used before (Intelligible).</li>
<li>Well documented data should contain all the details necessary to
reproduce the experiments, helping the future you or someone taking over
from you in the laboratory.</li>
<li>Saves time and money.</li>

<h2 id="fair-vs-open-science-3-min-teaching">FAIR vs Open Science (3 min teaching)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#fair-vs-open-science-3-min-teaching"></a></h2>
<p><strong>FAIR does not mean Open</strong>. Actually, FAIR guideline
only requires that the metadata record is always accessible. For
example, the existence of the data can be known (their metadata), the
data can have easy to use PID to reference them, but the actual data
files can only be downloaded after the login and authorization.</p>
<p>However, if data are already in the FAIR form, i.e. accessible over
the internet, in interoperable format and well documented, then it is
almost effortless to “open” the dataset and make it available to the
whole public. The data owner can do it any time when he no longer
perceives oppening as a risk.</p>
<p>At the same time, Open data which does not follow FAIR guidelines
have little value. If they are not well described, not in open formats
then they are not going to be re-used even if they were made “open” by
posting them on some website.</p>
